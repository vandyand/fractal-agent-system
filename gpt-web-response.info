To enable web search on OpenAI API LLM requests (such as GPT-4.1-mini), here's how it works as of July 2025:

## How to Enable Web Search on GPT-4.1-mini API Calls

- Use the **Responses API** endpoint.
- Add the `tools` parameter with the web search tool:  
  ```json
  "tools": [{ "type": "web_search_preview" }]
  ```
- Example request payload:
  ```json
  {
    "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "tools": [{ "type": "web_search_preview" }],
    "input": "What was a positive news story from today?"
  }
  ```
- You can also use the `tool_choice` parameter to force usage of the web search tool if needed[1].

## Pricing for Web Search Requests

- Web search incurs the **same per-token rates as normal API usage** for the model:
  - **GPT-4.1-mini:** $0.40 per 1M input tokens, $0.10 per 1M cached input tokens, $1.60 per 1M output tokens, $0.42 per 1M cached output tokens[2][3].
- There is **no separate fee solely for using web search**; the main cost is the token usage, though there may be a minimal tool call cost that is usually negligible.
- If you use higher "search context size" values, it can result in more tokens processed during the search step, potentially increasing cost, but still billed at the same per-token rate[1].

## Do Responses Contain References to Web Results?

- **Yes.** When web search is used, the API response includes:
  - The model's generated message (text answer).
  - Inline citations pointing to URLs from the search[1][4].
  - An `annotations` array in the response detailing each reference (with URL, title, position)[1].
- These references are **explicit** and allow you to show users what sources were actually referenced or included.

## Important Notes & Limitations

- Web search is not currently supported on the smallest (nano) variant; it is supported on **GPT-4.1-mini** and full GPTâ€‘4.1[1][5][6].
- The feature is in the Responses API, not the standard completions endpoint.
- Inline references and source annotations are always part of the output when the web search tool is invoked.

**Summary:**  
You enable web search in GPT-4.1-mini requests via the Responses API using the `tools` parameter. The price is simply the per-token rate for the model (no extra search fees), and all responses with web data include explicit inline citations and a reference list of sources used in the answer[1][5][2].
